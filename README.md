# Hypothesis-Testing and Chi-square Analysis
### Hypothesis Testing
## Bombay Hospitality Ltd. Franchise Operating Cost Analysis

### Background
 This repository contains a detailed Python script to perform hypothesis testing on the weekly operating costs for Bombay Hospitality Ltd.'s franchise operations. The goal is to investigate restaurant owners' claims that the observed weekly operating costs are higher than the theoretical model suggests.

### Contents
1. Hypothesis Statement: Defines the null and alternative hypotheses to assess the accuracy of the existing cost model.
2. Test Statistic Calculation: Calculates the test statistic using the provided sample data and theoretical cost model.
3. Critical Value Determination: Uses a 5% significance level to determine the critical value from the Z-distribution.
4. Decision Making: Compares the test statistic with the critical value to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.
5. Conclusion: Provides a clear conclusion on whether there is strong evidence to support the restaurant owners' claims.

### Chi-square Analysis

### Association Between Device Type and Customer Satisfaction
This repository contains a detailed analysis of the relationship between the type of smart home device purchased (Smart Thermostats vs. Smart Lights) and customer satisfaction levels using the Chi-Square test for independence.

### Objective
The objective of this analysis is to determine whether there is a significant association between the type of smart home device (Smart Thermostats vs. Smart Lights) and customer satisfaction levels. The Chi-Square test for independence is used to evaluate this relationship based on the provided data.

### Hypotheses Statement
1. Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and customer satisfaction level.
2. Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and customer satisfaction level.
### Chi-Square Statistic Calculation
The Chi-Square statistic is calculated using the observed and expected frequencies in the contingency table. This involves:

1. Calculating the expected frequencies for each cell in the table.
2. Applying the Chi-Square formula to compute the statistic.

### Decision Making
The computed Chi-Square statistic is compared with the critical value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. This decision indicates whether there is a statistically significant association between the device type and customer satisfaction level.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the repository provides a conclusion on whether there is a significant association between the type of smart home device purchased and customer satisfaction levels.
